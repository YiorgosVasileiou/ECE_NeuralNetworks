## Lab 1: Classifier Performance Comparison on Epileptic Seizure Recognition Data Set

Binary classification on the ESR Data Set on Classes 1 vs 2,3,4 and 5. Icludes data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as classifier hyperparamter optimization. Classifiers are scored by F1_micro and F1_macro scores.

## Lab 2: Movie Corpus TFIDF Vectorization and Semantic Classification SOMs

Excercise on the Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus dataset. *First part* is hyperparameter optimization of TFIDF vectorizer to for keyword extraction from movie descriptions and *seccond part* includes K-means clustering in SOM to achieve topological and semantic mapping on genres. Includes data-preprocessing and classifier evaluation.

## Lab 3: Image Classification on CIFAR100 dataset with CNNs

Networks built and evaluatied with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. Trained networks include from-scratch created, trained and optimized CNNs, as well as networks utilizing transfered learning from latest VGG19, ResNet and Xception CNNs. Optimizations introduced and evaluated include network arcitecture (batch layers, pooling layers and pooling strategy) as well as hyperparameter optimization.

## Lab 4: Reinforcement Learning Agents to play ENDURO on Atari2600

Reinforcement Learning agents' training and comparisson on various Stable Baselines 3 (SB3) environments. Excercise includes cross-training models on various environments to achieve both ease-of-training and agent performance. Furthermore includes evaluation on non-deterministic SB3 environments, to quantify agent overtraining
